# Secant Method
The `Newton-Raphson` method requires the evaluation of two function, the function and it's derivatives par each iteration. If they are complicated it will take considerable ammount of time and effort to do hand calculation or a large ammount of CPU time for machine calculation.
Hence it is desirable to have a method thar converges as fast as Newton's method yet involves only the evaluation of two initial approximations for the root "s" of ![f(x)](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f%28x%29=0)  and ![f(x0)](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f(x_0)) & ![f(x1)](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f(x_1)) respectively are their function values. If ![f(x0)](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_2) is the point of intersection of  X-Axis and line joining the ![f(x0)](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?point(x_0,%20f(x_0))) and ![f(x0)](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?point(x_1,%20f(x_1))) then ![f(x0)](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_2)  is closer to "s" than ![f(x0)](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_0)  and ![f(x0)](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_1) . The equation relating ![f(x0)](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_0) , ![f(x0)](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_1)  and ![f(x0)](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_2)  is found by considering the slope "m"
```math
SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
``` 
![f(x0)](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m%20=%20\frac{f(x_1)%20-%20f(x_0)}{x_1%20-%20x_0}%20=%20\frac{f(x_2)%20-%20f(x_1)%20}{x_2%20-![f(x0)](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_1)x_1}%20%20=%20\frac{0%20-%20f(x_1)%20}{x_2%20-%20x_1})
$$x_2-x_1 = \frac{-f(x_1)*(x_1 - x_0)}{f(x_1) - f(x_0)}$$$$x_2=x_1 - \frac{f(x_1)*(x_1 - x_0)}{f(x_1) - f(x_0)}$$
Or in general the iterative process can be written as
$$x_(i+1) = x_i \frac{f(x_i) * (x_i - x_(i-1))}{f(x_i) - f(x_(i-1))}$$$$i = 1, 2, 3, 4...$$
This formula is similar to `Regular-Falsi` scheme of root bracketing methods but differs in the implementation. The  `Regular-Falsi` method begins with the two initial approximations "a" and "b" sush that, $a\leqslant s\leqslant b$ where "s" is the root of $f(x) = 0$. It proceeds to the next iteration by calculating $c(x_2)$ using the above formula and then chooses one fo the interval $(a,c)$ or $(c,h)$ on $f(a) * f(c) < 0$ or $>0$ respectively. On teh other hand secant method starts with two initial approximation $x_0$ and $x_1$ and then calculates the $x_2$ by the same formula as in `Regular-Falsi` Method but proceeds to the next iteration without bothering about any root bracketing.
